 * This is an attempt at a real and applicable (in terms of algorithmic running time) queue.
 * It is my first attempt at creating a queue, having only learned how and when to use them.
 * As I wrote the code I realized that a insertion and deletion into an array would take O(n)
 * time. Professor Roughgarden(?) would be disappointed. "Can we do better?"
 * A data structure that excels at insertion and deletion is a linkedlist. Furthermore queues do
 * not need look-up capabilities (the major advantage to an array).
 * As such I switched gears and began writing my first linkedlist. This queue will then
 * implement that linkedlist.
