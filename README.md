This repository is for posting personal implementations of data structures and (associated) algorithms. I intend to first re-code the data structures and algorithms from Stanford Universities' Algorithm Design and Analysis, but I will also post all data structures and algorithms I code in University of Toronto's Computer Algorithms and Data Structures, a course I am currently taking. I will also post code I write from any courses (UofT or coursera.org) I will take in the future.

I will also post problems I find on-line and my attempt at solutions to those problems (they count as algorithms). 

I encourage my classmates from high school and UofT to freely review my code and also contribute by pointing out and fixing bugs, adding features, and changing code to faster implementations. I also especially welcome challenges/problems!
