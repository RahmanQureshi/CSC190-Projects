#CSC190 Computer Algorithms and Data Structures Projects#

A collection of data structures written in C for CSC190. There is also a Linked list written in java.

##Compiling##

If there is a MakeFile, type in `make`, otherwise type `./make-gcc`. This will output a 'tester' file and remove all object files.

##Usage##

Run the tester using `./[testerFileName]`. You will be given a prompt for a command. Use commands such as `insert`, `delete,` `find` and `print` to interact with the data structure. Monitor memory management by running the tester with the following line: `./valgrind [testerFileName]`
